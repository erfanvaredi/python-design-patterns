# Python Design Patterns

In this repository I've been developing some guideline for developers/data scientists wanting empower their programming skill and scalable softwares

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install jupyter.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then install the notebook library.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To start using the examples in a jupyter notebook env you can first run the jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


## Content

For having scalable and high performance softwares and also easy to reuse codes we need to follow some of the pre-tested design patters which we will get through them step by step. In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. There are several types of design patterns in Python, including:

+ **Creational patterns**: These design patterns focus on creating objects in a flexible and efficient manner. Examples include the factory pattern and the builder pattern. âœ…

+ **Structural patterns**: These design patterns focus on how objects are composed to form larger structures. Examples include the adapter pattern and the decorator pattern. âœ…

+ **Behavioral patterns**: These design patterns focus on communication between objects and the distribution of responsibility. Examples include the observer pattern and the template method pattern. ðŸš§

+ **Concurrency patterns**: These design patterns focus on managing concurrent access to shared resources. Examples include the thread pool pattern and the producer-consumer pattern. ðŸš§

+ **GoF (Gang Of Four)**: ðŸš§

# Python Design Patterns | Behavioral Design Patterns

In software engineering, **behavioral design patterns** are design patterns that deal with communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install jupyter.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then install the notebook library.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To start using the examples in a jupyter notebook env you can first run the jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


## Content

There are several behavioral design patterns in Python, including:

+ **Chain of responsibility pattern**: The chain of responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be passed through a chain of objects, with each object having the opportunity to handle the request or pass it along to the next object in the chain. ðŸš§

+ **Command pattern**: The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to separate the request from the object that handles it. ðŸš§

+ **Interpreter pattern**: The interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a grammar for a simple language and interpret sentences in that language. ðŸš§

+ **Iterator pattern**: The iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially, without exposing the underlying representation. ðŸš§

+ **Mediator pattern**: The mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, reducing the dependencies between them. ðŸš§

+ **Observer pattern**: The observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object changes state and all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. ðŸš§

It is important to note that creational design patterns are not specific to Python, and many of the design patterns described above have counterparts in other programming languages.

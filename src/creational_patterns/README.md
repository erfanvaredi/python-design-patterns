# Python Design Patterns | Creational Design Patterns

In software engineering, **creational design patterns** are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install jupyter.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then install the notebook library.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To start using the examples in a jupyter notebook env you can first run the jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


## Content

There are several creational design patterns in Python, including:

+ **Factory pattern**: The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

+ **Abstract factory pattern**: The abstract factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

+ **Builder pattern**: The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

+ **Prototype pattern**: The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the creation of new objects by copying existing objects, rather than creating new objects from scratch.

+ **Singleton pattern**: The singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to that instance.

It is important to note that creational design patterns are not specific to Python, and many of the design patterns described above have counterparts in other programming languages.

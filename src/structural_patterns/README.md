# Python Design Patterns | Structural Design Patterns

In software engineering, **structural design patterns** are design patterns that deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install jupyter.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then install the notebook library.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To start using the examples in a jupyter notebook env you can first run the jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


## Content

There are several structural design patterns in Python, including:

+ **Adapter pattern**: The adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an interface around an existing class. âœ…

+ **Bridge pattern**: The bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. ðŸš§

+ **Composite pattern**: The composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures and treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. âœ…

+ **Decorator pattern**: The decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new behavior to existing objects dynamically by wrapping them in decorator objects. âœ…

+ **Facade pattern**: The facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding the complexity behind the facade. ðŸš§

+ **Proxy pattern**: The proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object for another object and controls access to it. ðŸš§

It is important to note that structural design patterns are not specific to Python, and many of the design patterns described above have counterparts in other programming languages.
